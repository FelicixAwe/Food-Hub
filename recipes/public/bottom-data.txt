        1. For the sauce, peel and crush the garlic, peel and very finely grate the ginger and add to a pan with the remaining ingredients. Place over a medium-high heat until beginning to bubble; reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, or until thickened and syrupy. Remove from the heat and set aside.
        2. Prepare your deep-fat fryer if you have one. Otherwise, pour the vegetable oil into a large pot, to no higher than 5cm below the rim, and use a thermometer. Place over a medium-high heat and, using a thermometer to guide you, bring the oil to 150ºC.
        3. Meanwhile, combine the flours, baking powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 2 teaspoons of sea salt in a bowl. Add the chicken, toss to coat, then gently shake off any excess. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook, in batches, for 12 minutes. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.
        4. Increase the temperature of the oil to 185ºC. Return the chicken to the oil, in batches again, and fry for 6 more minutes, until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain as before.
        5. Reheat the sauce, if necessary, then gently toss with the chicken to coat completely. Serve the sticky wings piled up with the sesame seeds and thinly sliced chives scattered over.

        1. Wipe the mushrooms clean, trim the stalks, halve any larger mushrooms, then dry char in a large non-stick casserole pan on a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until dark golden and beautifully nutty, turning halfway.
        2. Meanwhile, peel the carrots and finely slice into rounds at an angle. Trim and roughly slice the scallions. Drain the tofu and chop into eight chunks.
        3. Pull the skin off the chicken thighs and discard. Use the heel of a large knife to cut each thigh through the bone into three pieces by carefully and firmly tapping the knife with a rolling pin—this will add more flavor to the broth.
        4. Remove the mushrooms to a plate, and add the chicken and carrots to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly.
        5. Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes.
        6. Stir in the scallions, mushrooms, tofu, soy sauce, and chili paste and simmer for a final 20 minutes.
        7. Chop the kimchee and stir through just before serving (this means it isn’t overexposed to heat, so will retain more of its nutritional benefit).
        8. While the soup is simmering, cook the noodles according to the package instructions, then drain. Toss with the sesame oil and seeds, and divide between your bowls.
        9. Taste the broth, season to perfection, then squeeze in lime juice to add contrast. Divide between your hot noodle bowls, and enjoy.

        1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.
        2. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and nutty.
        3. Put the kimchi, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds into a blender, and whiz until smooth.
        4. Place the chicken in a snug-fitting baking tray. Pour one third of the marinade over the chicken and rub it in to all the nooks and crannies. Roast for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until everything is gnarly and cooked through.
        5. Add the honey to the remaining marinade and blitz until combined. Pour half into a small bowl and set aside – this will be your dipping sauce. Keep the rest of the sauce for your glaze.
        6. For the buns, cut out 12 x 8cm squares of greaseproof paper and rub each one with a little sesame oil to stop the buns sticking. Pour the coconut milk into a large mixing bowl, then add the flour and a good pinch of sea salt. Start mixing with a fork then get in there with your hands and knead until you have a soft, smooth dough – or do all this in a food processor.
        7. Tip the dough onto a flour-dusted work surface and roll into a sausage shape. Quarter it, then cut each piece into three to make 12 even-sized pieces and roll each into a ball. One-by-one, with a rolling pin, roll the balls into 10cm x 12cm ovals. Lay an oiled chopstick across the middle like a hinge, fold the dough in half and pull the chopstick out. Place each bun on a little rectangle of greaseproof paper ready for steaming.
        8. Remove the chicken from the oven and turn it off. Spoon over the reserved glaze to create another sticky layer and sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds. Transfer to a plate and return to the oven to keep warm and tighten up the glaze while you cook the buns.
        9. Working in batches, place the buns on their greaseproof squares into a large bamboo steamer and pop the lid on. Place the steamer over a large frying pan or wok filled with 300ml of boiling water and steam for 8 to 10 minutes, or until fluffy and cooked through.
        10. For the slaw, scrub the carrots, trim the spring onions and chillies (deseed if you like), bok choi and cabbage. Finely zest and juice the limes into a serving bowl, add a little sesame oil and a good pinch of gochugaru. Finely chop all the slaw ingredients, drop them into the dressing bowl and toss with your hands to dress.
        11. Shred the chicken and serve with the coconut buns, slaw and remaining sauce.

        1. Remove the outer leaves and the stem of the cabbage.
        2. Using a sharp knife, make a cut about 10cm up the cabbage to the base and use it to gently pull the cabbage in half (this helps to keep the leaves whole without shredding them).
        3. Repeat the process with each half so that the cabbage is quartered.
        4. Fill a large bowl with cold water and submerge each of the cabbage quarters fully, then remove from the, water and shake them to get rid of any excess water.
        5. Take a small handful of salt and rub it up and down each leaf of 1 cabbage quarter, ensuring the thicker parts closer to the stalk are particularly well covered.
        6. Repeat with the remaining quarters, then transfer to a large, clean, clip lock plastic container and leave to brine for 3 hours, turning the cabbage quarters every 30 minutes to make sure the salt is distributed evenly over the cabbage.
        7. Meanwhile, make the kimchi "glue". Bring the stock to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the sweet rice flour, reduce the heat to a simmer and whisk together until there are no lumps and the mixture is thick enough to easily coat the back of a spoon. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
        8. Trim and finely slice the spring onions, then peel and finely chop the carrot, garlic and ginger. Core and finely chop the apple (leaving the skin on), then add all this, along with the fish sauce and saeujot, to the thickened "glue" and mix together thoroughly (this is easiest done by hand, wearing gloves).
        9. After brining, thoroughly wash the cabbages under cold running water to remove any excess salt or sediment that that be trapped between the leaves, then shake dry.
        10. Take a small handful of the "glue" and rub it up and down each leaf of 1 cabbage quarter to coat, making sure that the thicker parts nearer the base are particularly well covered as before. Repeat with the remaining cabbage quarters.
        11. Fold over the top third of each cabbage quarter into its centre, then fold over the outer leaves to form a parcel. Pack the kimchi parcels tightly into the large container.
        12. Spoon any leftover "glue" into the container to fill any gaps – this will help form a barrier against the air and prevent mould. Be sure to leave some space at the top of the container though, as the kimchi will need some room to ferment and expand (without it, you could end up with a kimchi explosion).
        13. Leave at room temperature for 3 to 4 days to ferment, then transfer to the refrigerator until needed.
        14. The kimchi will continue to ferment but at a much slower rate, so every day it’ll taste a little sharper and a little tangier. Enjoy with everything.

        "name": "Tuna Carpaccio - Japanese Style",
        "description": "
        This is a wonderfully simple, almost exotic light meal that fills you with a big smile. Make sure you get really fresh tuna – it needs to be red and almost waxy-looking.
        You can try using different fish, such as salmon, bream or scallops, just make sure they’re all really nice and fresh and smell of nothing but the sea.
        Get your tuna, and with a long sharp knife slice it as thinly as you can. Once you’ve sliced it, you can smooth it over with the side of your knife to make it even thinner. Divide this in one layer between your plates, or it’s even nicer to serve it on one big plate.
        Next, use this brilliant Japanese trick: cut a V-shaped vertical slit in the mooli and stuff the chilli in. This means that when you grate it you get a pink-coloured, chilli-flavoured radish pulp, which is fantastic. If you haven’t got mooli you can get the same effect by finely chopping the chilli and grating normal radishes.
        So, either grate or chop your mooli or radish and then blob it and its juice over the tuna slices and sprinkle over the shiso or coriander.
        When you serve it squeeze half a lime and a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce over each portion, to taste, then drizzle with a little olive oil.
        * Shiso is a Japanese herb with a strong flavour reminiscent of aniseed.

        1.Preheat the oven to 190°C. Wipe the cavity of the chicken with a paper towel. Remove excess fat. Place a little butter, a little salt and pepper, tarragon or parsley stalks and strips of orange or lemon rind inside chicken cavity. Truss with string.
        2.Wipe outside of bird, spread with remaining butter and place breast-side up in a small baking dish, preferably on a rack. Pour 1 cup of water in with 1/2 cup of the stock and place in the oven for 10 minutes, basting once or twice with the liquid underneath. Turn on side and baste well with stock. Continue to cook for a further 20 minutes, basting and adding more stock as necessary. Turn chicken to other side and cook, basting, for a further 20 minutes.
        3.Turn bird on its back for a further 15 minutes or so to brown the breast. There should be just enough stock to keep the juice in the dish from scorching; if not, add more water. To test, run a fine skewer into the thigh joint of the chicken. If the juice that runs out is clear and colourless, the chicken is cooked. Take chicken from dish and remove string. Keep in a warm place.
        4.While the chicken is cooking, prepare the garnish. Place the mushrooms with the tomatoes, onions and olives around chicken for the last 20 minutes of cooking. Serve the chicken surrounded by vegetables. Scatter with parsley.
